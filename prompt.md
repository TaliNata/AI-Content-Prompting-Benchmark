The avatar is intended for short UGC-style videos where she talks
about dietary supplements (health supplements).

Style & Mood:
Natural, neutral, and approachable.
No exaggerated emotions.
No advertising or influencer aesthetics.
The overall impression should be credible and human.

Realistic skin texture, natural lighting, subtle facial asymmetry.
Soft daylight, front-facing camera angle, eye-level perspective.
Simple background (home or studio-like), uncluttered.

Constraints:
No logos.
No text.
No product packaging visible.
No medical symbols.
No exaggerated beauty standards.
No plastic or over-smoothed skin.
No cinematic or fantasy effects.

Framing:

Centered composition.

The image should look like a real person ready to record a casual,
trust-based UGC video about supplements.
