# Conclusions — UGC Avatar Image Benchmark

## Evaluation Context

All images were generated using the same prompt describing a realistic AI-generated female avatar intended for trust-based UGC videos about dietary supplements.  
The evaluation focuses on **visual realism, trustworthiness, brand safety, and suitability for health-related UGC content**, rather than artistic appeal.

## Nano Banana Pro (Baseline)

Nano Banana Pro produced the most **natural and context-appropriate UGC avatar** among the tested models.  
The facial features appear realistic, with balanced proportions, natural skin texture, and minimal signs of over-processing.

The overall impression is that of a real, everyday professional person rather than a model or influencer.  
Background, lighting, and framing support a casual, trust-based video scenario, making the output well suited for health-related UGC use cases.

**Strengths:**
- High perceived realism
- Neutral, non-advertising appearance
- Strong alignment with UGC and trust-based content requirements

## MidJourney (v7)

MidJourney generated a visually polished and aesthetically pleasing avatar, with strong facial symmetry and clean lighting.  
However, the result leans toward a **model-like, editorial look**, which reduces perceived authenticity for UGC scenarios.

The image appears more curated and stylized, which may be effective for creative or branding contexts but less optimal for trust-focused health communication.

**Strengths:**
- High visual quality
- Strong facial detail and composition

**Limitations:**
- Overly refined appearance
- Reduced “everyday human” authenticity for UGC health videos

## Seedream 4.5

Seedream 4.5 delivered a balanced and conservative visual result, with a calm expression and neutral styling.  
The avatar appears credible and human, though slightly flatter in depth and detail compared to the baseline.

While suitable for trust-oriented content, the image lacks some of the subtle realism cues (skin variation, micro-details) that enhance perceived authenticity on camera.

**Strengths:**
- Neutral and brand-safe appearance
- Appropriate tone for informational content

**Limitations:**
- Lower visual richness
- Less lifelike detail compared to Nano Banana Pro

---

## Comparative Summary

Across identical prompt conditions, the models demonstrate distinct tendencies:

- **Nano Banana Pro** is best aligned with realistic UGC avatar requirements, balancing realism, trust, and non-advertising aesthetics.
- **MidJourney** prioritizes visual polish and stylization, which may conflict with authenticity expectations in health-related UGC.
- **Seedream 4.5** provides a safe and neutral output but with less visual depth and realism.

## Final Conclusion

The benchmark confirms that **model choice significantly impacts perceived trustworthiness and realism**, even when using the same high-constraint prompt.  
For UGC videos in the health and supplements domain—where credibility and human likeness are critical—models optimized for realistic, non-stylized avatars offer a clear advantage.

This highlights the importance of selecting image-generation models not only based on visual quality, but also on **contextual suitability and audience trust requirements**.
